# Botcamp (Game created during Bitcamp 2016)
**About**: This is a desktop strategy game developed using C#, Unity, and Microsoft Visual Studio. It was created by myself and three other teammates during the 2016 Bitcamp Hackathon at University of Maryland College Park. The game objective of Botcamp is for users to build a robot for each level and then navigate mazes and obstacles in order to reach a goal.

**To play the game**: Download Build.zip and extract all files, then run Botcamp.exe and select your preferred screen size, graphics quality, and monitor *(the botcamp_Data folder must be in the same folder as botcamp.exe otherwise it will not run)*. The controls to move your robot are the WASD keys. To exit the game at any time, press Alt+F4.

**My role**: Writing functions for things such as the timer, keeping a point total, deducting points when obstacles were hit, level selection, etc. I also created graphics and implemented designs for each level.
